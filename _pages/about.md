# Nice to meet you!
I'm a PhD student at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona ([UAB](https://www.uab.cat/)) currently working at the Center for Mathematical Research ([CRM](https://crm.cat)) and the Institute of Marine Research ([ICM-CSIC](https://www.icm.csic.es/en)). My passion is climate science and cats.

## Motivation
My desire is to contribute to a better understanding of our past, present and future climate system. What excites me personally about climate science is its extraordinary interdisciplinarity, which allows me to immerse myself in physics & mathematics, chemistry & biology, big data & programming, history and science communication, and to meet people with diverse backgrounds and passions.

## Current research interest
Central to my research is the predictability of extreme precipitation events on sub-seasonal time scales. In particular, I am interested in the question which predictors of the climate system can influence and ultimately improve the predictability of such events. Methodologically, I use neural networks in combination with explainable AI techniques.

In addition, I am interested in:
- Climate variability during the Holocene and possible influences on early civilizations.
- Structuring of coastal pollution by marine litter
- ENSO variability and possible influences on global trade volumes
- Data visualization
- Clean code


## News
Our work on complex Maximum Covariance Analysis was recently [published](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0244.1). The paper comes along with an easy-to-use Python package ([xMCA](https://github.com/nicrie/xmca)). You will find the key points of the technique summed up in a [short review](code.html).
